# Kill la Kill
I created this game a few years ago in XNA. However, since then XNA has been totatlly deprecated and Monogame has taken its place. So, I have recreated the game inside Monogame to keep its legacy alive. This game is based on the anime series: Kill la Kill. 

The premise of the game is to gather the most points by defending against Satsuki's barraging attacks! The controls for the game are the up and down arrows for defending respective attacks, and on a gamepad the left stick is the direction of your defense (up and down only).
