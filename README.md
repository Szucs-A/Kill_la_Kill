# Kill la Kill
I created this game a few years ago in XNA. However, since then XNA has been totatlly deprecated and Monogame has taken its place. So, I have recreated the game inside Monogame to keep its legacy alive. This game is based on the anime series: Kill la Kill. 

The premise of the game is to gather the most points by defending against Satsuki's barraging attacks! The controls for the game are inside the *Controls.txt* file in the source. This text file contains both keyboard and gamepad controls.
